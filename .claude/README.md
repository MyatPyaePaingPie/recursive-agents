# .claude Directory

This directory contains context and instructions specifically for AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to help them understand and work with this project effectively.

## Files

- **CLAUDE.md** - Detailed instructions for Claude Code on code style, patterns, and project preferences
- **TODO.md** - Development roadmap and task tracking
- **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Complete project overview and what's been built
- **decisions.md** - Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) explaining why design choices were made
- **gotchas.md** - Known issues, pitfalls, and troubleshooting tips
- **patterns.md** - Code patterns and best practices specific to this project
- **research.md** - Summary of the Recursive Language Models research paper

## Purpose

These files help AI coding assistants:
- Understand the project architecture and goals
- Follow consistent coding patterns
- Avoid known issues and pitfalls
- Make informed decisions aligned with project philosophy
- Generate code that matches the existing style

## For Developers

While these files are optimized for AI assistants, they're also useful for human developers to understand:
- Why certain architectural decisions were made
- What coding patterns to follow
- Known issues to watch out for
- The research paper this project implements
